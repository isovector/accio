ACCIO YELP PRESENTATION
-Problem statement:
	-Help people get things done
		-putting things in a calendar can really help actually finishing it
		-get that "back burner" stuff back into your work cycle
		-be more productive!
-Demo:
	-Create tasks, add due dates and duration stuff
	-create work blocks
	-schedule it on the calendar with magic!

-Current finished tasks and next steps:
	Joel Test:
		-Play framework helps us in a lot of ways
			-Repo layout for free
			-Build system auto-detects and recompiles
			-Test harness with ScalaTest
			-No bug db yet

	-Already build exploratory prototype
		-Backend should be flexible for multiple different UI implementations

	-Design decisions
		-Play framework with scala was the big bet
		-AngularJS for front end was good choice, we have experience and is probably the most popular framework out there

	-Productivity
		-Hella productive!
			-~800 lines of scala code
			-200-300 lines of HTML
			-~200 lines of JS 

	Roadmap:
		-Finished in prototype:
			-Ability to add tasks
				-add, edit delete
			-Ability to add work blocks
			-Basic scheduling algorithms

		-Next steps:
			-Formalize UI
			-Flesh out some of the web pages, get some better UI
			-Create next generation scheduling algorithm
				-Not just time constraints, what is important to you?
				-Give people choices, then remember from their choices
